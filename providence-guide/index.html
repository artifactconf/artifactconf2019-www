<h2>Some Things You Should Know About RI Food</h2>

<p><strong>Del's Lemonade</strong>&mdash;Del's founder Angelo DeLucia originally got his recipe for Del's lemonade from his father, Franco DeLucia, who brought the recipe to the United States from Italy. The first Del's stand was a small, pushable cart in Cranston, Rhode Island, in 1948. Soon after, he started using "Del's Trucks" to serve the beverage anywhere in the state. The company still uses the trucks today in addition to its storefront locations.</p>

<p><strong>Coffee Milk</strong>&mdash;Coffee milk was introduced to Rhode Island sometime in the early 1930s. It came about from creative diner and drugstore operators trying to attract new customers with new and innovative drinks. One of these operators, the identity of whom has been lost to history, sweetened leftover coffee grounds with milk and sugar. This created a molasses-like extract that became popular. Coffee milk became a favorite among Rhode Islanders and Southeastern Massachusetts residents, and created a demand for this coffee syrup. The demand was so great that, in 1993, it beat out Del's Lemonade as the official drink of Rhode Island.</p>

<p><strong>New York System wiener</strong>&mdash;is a staple of the food culture of Rhode Island. It is typically made from a small, thin frankfurter made of veal and pork, thus giving it a different taste from a traditional hot dog made of beef. Placed in a steamed bun, the wiener is topped with a meat sauce seasoned with a myriad of spices like cumin, paprika, chili powder and allspice, which is itself covered in finely chopped onions, celery salt and yellow mustard. The term &ldquo;New York System&rdquo; originated in the early 1900s, when hot dogs began appearing in Rhode Island but were still associated primarily with New York.</p>

<h2>GET YOUR HISTORY ON</h2>
  <p>Providence was founded in 1636 by Roger Williams, a religious exile from the Massachusetts Bay Colony. He named the area in honor of &quot;God's merciful Providence&quot; which he believed was responsible for revealing such a haven for him and his followers to settle.</p>
  <p>Following the Revolutionary war, Providence was the country's ninth-largest city. The economy shifted from maritime endeavors to manufacturing, particularly machinery, tools, silverware, jewelry and textiles. </p>
  <p>By the turn of the twentieth century, Providence boasted some of the largest manufacturing plants in the country. The city's industries attracted many immigrants from Ireland, Germany, Sweden, England, Italy, Portugal, Cape Verde, and French Canada.</p>
  <p>The Great Depression hit the city hard, and Providence's downtown was subsequently flooded by the New England Hurricane of 1938. </p>
  <p>From the 1950s to the 1980s, Providence was a notorious bastion of organized crime.</p>
  <p>The city's &quot;Renaissance&quot; began in the 1970s. In the 1990s, Mayor Vincent Cianci, Jr showcased the city's strength in arts and pushed for further revitalization, ultimately resulting in the uncovering of the city's natural rivers (which had been covered by paved bridges), relocation of a large section of railroad underground, creation of river walks along the river's banks, and construction of a skating rink downtown and the Providence Place Mall.</p>
<h2>OTHER INTERESTING FACTS</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>The city gained the reputation as one of the most active and growing gay communities in the Northeast; the rate of reported gay and lesbian relationships is 75% higher than the national average. The former mayor, David Cicilline, won his election running as an openly gay man, making him the first openly gay mayor of a U.S. state capital.</li>
    <li>The city is also the home of the Tony Award-winning theater group Trinity Repertory Company, the Providence Black Repertory Company, and the Rhode Island Philharmonic Orchestra. Providence is the home of several performing arts centers such as the Veterans Memorial Auditorium, the Providence Performing Arts Center, and the Providence Festival Ballet. The city's underground music scene, centered around artist-run spaces, is known in underground music circles (Fete Olneyville).</li>
    <li>The East Side is also home to the First Baptist Church in America, the oldest Baptist church in the Americas, founded by Roger Williams in 1638, as well as the Old State House, which served as the state's capital from 1762 to 1904. Nearby is Roger Williams National Memorial. The State Capitol building is the fourth largest unsupported dome in the world (the second largest marble dome after St. Peter's Basilica in Rome). Downtown there is the Westminster Arcade, which is the oldest enclosed shopping center in the U.S.</li>
    <li>The main art museum is the Rhode Island School of Design Museum. In addition to the Providence Public Library and its nine branches, the city is home to the Providence Athenæum, the fourth oldest library in the country. Here, on one of his many visits to Providence, Edgar Allan Poe, met and courted a love interest named Sarah Helen Whitman. Poe was a regular fixture there, as was H. P. Lovecraft (who was born in Providence); both of them influential writers of gothic literature.</li>
