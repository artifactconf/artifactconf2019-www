                <p>Over the past several years, there has been a lot of conversation about how performance impacts key business metrics, but that's not all that's at stake. As sites grow heavier, using more JavaScript and images than ever, it's not just the business that feels the effects. Spotty networks, cheap devices, accessible tech and more struggle to handle the increasing demands we place on them. If we're not careful, the people down the street and around the world who rely on those technologies will be left out entirely. </p>

                <p>In this talk well explore performance outside the bubble and what we can do to make sure that we're not leaving people on the outside looking in.</p>

                <p>The job title &ldquo;front-end developer&rdquo; is very real: job boards around the world confirm that. But what is that job, exactly? What do you need to know to do it? You might think those answers are pretty cut and dried, but they&rsquo;re anything but; front-end development is going through something of an identity crisis. In this engaging talk, Chris will explore this identity through the lens of someone who has self-identified as a front-end developer for a few decades, but more interestingly, through many conversations he&rsquo;s had with other successful front-end developers. You&rsquo;ll see just how differently this job can be done and how differently people and companies can think of this role—not just for the sake of doing so, but because you&rsquo;ll learn to be better at your own jobs by understanding how other people are good at theirs.</p>

When someone emails you a <abbr title="Portable Document Format">PDF</abbr>, how do you know the best way to get started? Where should you use which code? How do you translate a static drawing into a dynamic layout? Having no idea what she&rsquo;s about to do, Jen Simmons will live code a design from start to finish (or however close to finish she gets before time&rsquo;s up). No net, no preparation. How does someone in the real world create a layout using the tools of Intrinsic Web Design?</p>

                <p>This is the tale of a very long redesign process of a responsive website built around the time of the last Artifact conference. After so many years apart, it's a good time to come together and look at some lessons learned. More importantly, we'll look at our code and update our understanding on some of the "best practices" from yesteryear we don't need anymore as the Web Platform has evolved. We can also take a peek at where it is going. Consider this a refresher course in Responsive Web Design.</p>

                <p>When people talk about making their digital content accessible to people with disabilities, it sounds cumbersome, expensive, and anything but agile. The list of accessibility compliance requirements is somehow both exhaustive and frustratingly undefined. This creates problems for agile teams in measuring success, and it represents a guaranteed way to kill your project&rsquo;s velocity.</p>

                <p>Just as agile-minded thinking can transform your company&rsquo;s culture, accessibility integration can actually serve as a catalyst for innovation and continuous improvement within your agile process. Learn how agile and accessibility make excellent partners in building a lean, cost-effective practice of user-centered, value-based design and development. From release planning to story writing, from estimation to testing, you&rsquo;ll leave equipped with the knowledge of how to successfully incorporate inclusive design at each level and for each role in your digital projects.</p>

                <p>Static sites have made a comeback as of late. This &ldquo;return to simplicity&rsquo; is unsurprising given the current complexity of websites and applications that make maintenance quite the nightmare. Regardless, static sites today are a far cry from their older counterparts. Static sites circa early 2000s consisted of static markup with some CSS thrown in for flavor. Today, static sites are much more dynamic and are a healthy mix of JavaScript, APIs and Markup, aka JAM. They are capable of more complex behavior like processing payments and making authentication requests that are traditionally associated with backend server logic. In this talk, let&rsquo;s dive into the wonderful world of the JAMstack and how we can harness it to make faster, more secure websites and applications.</p>

Consistency, headstarts, and shared standards are good for everyone. But where does that leave designers? How do we exercise the advantages of gorgeous art direction and intuitive interaction design? Why does it feel like the job we&rsquo;ve been successfully doing for years is quickly fading away? Dan Mall has been coaching and working with in-house teams on their design systems for a few years. In this talk, he&rsquo;ll share what he&rsquo;s learned about each team member&rsquo;s role, where to be efficient vs. where to be experimental, and how we can all better collaborate to benefit from everyone&rsquo;s knowledge and skills.</p>
